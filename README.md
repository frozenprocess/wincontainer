# wincontainer
A Windows-based containerized application workload written in `Go`.

This workload is based on Microsoft's `Windows Nano Server 1809` base image, making it a tiny demo application that can get an IP Address from Kubernetes in a matter of seconds. (Try coreserver I dare you!)

# C# edition?
The previous iteration was written in C# using `.Net6` framework, if you are eager to have it check the history.
